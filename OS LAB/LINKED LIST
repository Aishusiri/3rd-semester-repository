AIM: To implement linked file allocation technique
Check whether the selected location is free .
b) If the location is free allocate and set flag=1 to the allocated locations.
While allocating next location address to attach it to previous location
#include<stdio.h> 
main()
{
int f[50],p,i,j,k,a,st,len,n,c; 
clrscr();
for(i=0;i<50;i++) f[i]=0;
printf("Enter how many blocks that are already  allocated"); 
scanf("%d",&p); 
printf("\nEnter the blocks no.s that are already allocated"); 
for(i=0;i<p;i++)
{
scanf("%d",&a); 
f[a]=1;
}
X:
printf("Enter the starting index block & 
length"); scanf("%d%d",&st,&len); k=len;
for(j=st;j<(k+st);j++)
{
if(f[j]==0)
{ f[j]=1;
printf("\n%d->%d",j,f[j]);
}
else
{
printf("\n %d->file is already 
allocated",j);
k++;
}
}
printf("\n If u want to enter one 
more file? (yes-1/no-0)");
scanf("%d",&c); 
if(c==1)
goto 
X; 
else 
exit();
getch( );}

OUTPUT:
Enter how many blocks that are already allocated 3 Enter the blocks no.s 
that are already allocated 4 7 Enter the starting index block & length 3 7 9
3->1 
4->1 file is already allocated 
5->1
6->1
7->1 file is already allocated 
8->1
9->1file is already allocated 
10->1
11->1
12->1
